# Part-of-Speech Tagging using Hidden Markov Models
Developed a Hidden Markov Model part-of-speech tagger for Italian, Japanese and Urdu.

## HMM Learning
- Contains logic for calculating transition, emission and the initial probabilities matrices for tags and words.
- The command-line argument is a single file containing the training data; the program will learn the HMM, and write the model parameters to a file called hmmmodel.txt.

## HMM Decoding
- Contains logic for Viterbi decoding with open/closed class distinction to perform POS tagging.
- Utilizes model weights(transition, emission, initial probabilities matrices) generated by ``hmmlearn.py``.
- The command-line argument is a single file containing the test data; the program will read the parameters of the HMM from the file hmmmodel.txt, tag each word in the test data, and write the results to a text file called hmmoutput.txt in the same format as the training data.


## Execution

The learning program will be invoked in the following way:

``python hmmlearn.py /path/to/input``

The tagging program will be invoked in the following way:

``python hmmdecode.py /path/to/input``
